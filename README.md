[user manual] <br />
The duration calculation must be based on the time zone. Sample;  <br />
If you want it to turn off after 2 hours and 15 minutes, you have to type 2.25.  <br />
The value to be noted here is the value after the comma is fixed to 60.  <br />
If you write 2.5, the time will expire after 2 hours and 30 minutes,  <br />
if we write 2.60, (2.60*60=156 minutes = 1 hour and 36 minutes) then the time will expire.  <br />

rudely, the difference between them; <br />
2.30 = two hours eighteen minutes (2.30x60 = 138min / 138min = 2:18h) <br />
2.50 = two and a half hours (2.50x60 = 150min / 150min = 2:30h) <br />
2.60 = over two and a half hours (2.60x60 = 156min / 156min = 2:36h) <br />
2.88 = two hours fifty two minutes eight seconds (2.88x60 = 172.8min / 172.8min = 2:52:8h)  <br />

(x = x*60) = minutes to system off <br />
